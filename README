This project came to life because of the Twitch Hackalong Hackathon. Entering in the 'build anything' category, I have worked on interfacing a motorcycle instrument cluster (or dashboard).

The idea of Rev-Board is to provide streamers with a physical dashboard that displays analytics / notifications. A quick demo can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jkt7uGxbxU

After 14 straight hours of competing - and streaming the whole ordeal (www.twitch.tv/mtlsnk) - I'd decided to call it quits, and to continue at a later time.

What I've done so far:
- rewire all components
- replace 12V light bulbs with LEDs
- hack the tachometer (bypassing a PCB), exposing it to the microcontroller
- detach/remove the clock from the wiring
- expose the H (hour) / M (minute) buttons to the microcontroller
- test wiring
- write blinky program

Things to do:
- interface with an ESP8266 to get data over WiFi
- use a 12V power supply + voltage regulator (down to 5V for the microcontroller)
- design the logic that drives it all
- etc.
